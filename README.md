# RAK831-LoRaGateway-RPi
ttn_gateway based on the latest SX1301 driver [lora_gateway](https://github.com/Lora-net/lora_gateway) v5.0.1 and semtech [packet_forwarder](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder) v4.0.1  


##	Installation procedure

step1 : Download and install [Raspbian Stretch LITE](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) 


step2 : Clone the installer and start the installation

      $ git clone https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK831-LoRaGateway-RPi.git ~/rak831-loragateway
      $ cd ~/rak831-loragateway
      $ sudo ./install.sh

step3 : Next you will see some messages as follow. Just hit the Enter key to keep default or enter your information if you want.

      Descriptive name [ttn-rak831]:
      Latitude [0]:

step4 (Optional):If GPS is connected to gateway, after system restart, you must modify /opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json and add the following content if the "gateway_conf" item does not contain them. You must reboot gateway after modify the global_conf.json.
      
      "gateway_conf": {
